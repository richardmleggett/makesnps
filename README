makesnps takes a reference genome and outputs a copy with a specified number of SNPs in it, separated by a minimum distance.

It was used to create test data for bubbleparse (https://github.com/richardmleggett/bubbleparse) along with SimSeq (https://github.com/jstjohn/SimSeq) which was used for creating simulated reads.

To compile makesnps, just type:
cc -o makesnps makesnps.c

Syntax: makesnps [-i filename] [-o filename] [-c filename] [options]
where [-i filename] specifies the name of a reference genome in FASTA format.
      [-o filename] specifies the name of an output FASTA file.
      [-c filename] specifies the name of a CSV file to output containing SNP positions.
      [-s id] specifies the output sequence id (default 'makesnps').
      [-n int] specifies the number of SNPs to insert (default 1000).
      [-m int] specifies the minimum distance between SNPs (default 100).
      [-w int] specifies the column width of the output file (default 70).
